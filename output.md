A.  Are different if men propose than if women propose.
Express the happiness of each group (as the sum of the
ranks male partners and sum of ranks of women partners).

a: B,A,D,C  <br>
b: C,B,A,D  <br>
c: D,A,C,B  <br>
d: C,B,D,A  <br>

A: d,b,a,c  <br>
B: c,b,d,a  <br>
C: a,c,b,d  <br>
D: a,d,c,b  <br>

Women proposing to men
----------------------

<br>
Final Pairings are as follows:  <br>
A is paired with d rank  1  rank : 4  <br>
B is paired with b rank  2  rank : 2  <br>
C is paired with c rank  2  rank : 3  <br>
D is paired with a rank  1  rank : 3  <br>
the summed happiness (ranks) of the proposers is 6  <br>
The summed happiness (ranks) of the proposees is 12  <br>

Men proposing to women
----------------------

<br>
Final Pairings are as follows:  <br>
a is paired with A rank  2  rank : 3  <br>
b is paired with C rank  1  rank : 3  <br>
c is paired with D rank  1  rank : 3  <br>
d is paired with B rank  2  rank : 3  <br>
the summed happiness (ranks) of the proposers is 6  <br>
The summed happiness (ranks) of the proposees is 12  <br>

B. Produce the same result, regardless of who proposes.
This is a configuration where whichever group proposes, the result is the same.


a:      W,X,Z,Y   <br>
b:      W,Y,Z,X   <br>
c:      X,W,Y,Z   <br>
d:      W,Z,X,Y

W:      d,b,c,a   <br>
X:      d,b,a,c   <br>
Y:      a,d,b,c   <br>
Z:      b,a,d,c
